## Project Overview:
The AI-ML based intelligent de-smoking and de-hazing algorithm for real-time video enhancement in indoor fire hazard scenarios is a cutting-edge technology designed to significantly improve visibility and assist in rescue operations during indoor fire incidents. This innovative algorithm leverages the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to address the challenges posed by smoke and haze in indoor environments affected by fires.

## Tech Stack:

Below are the technologies and tools we used to build our AI solution:


* *Python :* <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.11.5-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python" alt="Python 3.11.5">
* *Numpy :* <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Numpy-1.26.0-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=numpy" alt="Numpy">
* *Keras :* <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Keras-2.14.0-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=keras" alt="Keras">
* *Tensorflow :* <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/tensorflow-2.13.0-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=tensorflow" alt="Tensorflow">
* *Matplotlib :* <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/matplotlib-3.8.0-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=matplotlib" alt="matplotlib">


## Project Features and Functionality:

*1. Smoke and Haze Removal:* <br /> The core functionality is to develop an algorithm that can effectively remove smoke and haze from images or videos. <br />

*2. Image Support:* <br /> Currently, our project is work on images & remove smoke/haze from image. <br />


## How It Works:
*Below is the workflow of our project:*

## Challenges and Solutions:

*1. Data collection:* Data collection was a big challenge faced by the team. But we overcame the challenge & collect available data from various sources. <br />

*2. Data pre-processing:* Data pre-processing was also a big challenge faced by the team. But we overcame the challenge & converted video to images by using Open CV library. <br />


## Future Enhancements:

*1. Image and Video Support:* If feasible, our secondary goal is to support both image and video input, allowing users to process individual images or entire video sequences. <br />

*2. Real-Time Processing:* <br /> If feasible, offer real-time processing capabilities for video de-smoking and de-hazing. <br />

## Screenshots and Demos:
Below is our AI solution which we made as a part of hackathon. We worked mainly on data collection & pre-processing task. This solution is incomplete & can be further improved.
